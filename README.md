notes
=====
Save plain-text notes to your server as you type. 
Each note has its own URL.

setup
-----
	npm install
	node app.js

philosophy
----------
Be something to take notes, without having to install
any software beyond the server. Make something useful
in a few days.

future plans
------------
* Not much at this point. 
* Maybe add some sort of authentication thing.
