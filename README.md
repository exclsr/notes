notes
=====
Save plain-text notes to your server as you type. 
Each note has its own URL.


setup
=====
	npm install

philosophy
===========
Be something to take notes, without having to install
any software beyond the server. Make something useful
in less than a day.

future plans
============
* Not much at this point. 
* Maybe list all the notes on the home page.
* Maybe add some sort of authentication thing.
