notes
=====
Save plain-text notes to your server as you type. 
Each note has its own URL.

how?
-----
	npm install
	node app.js

	http://server:3000

what?
----------
Be something to take notes, without having to install
any software beyond the server. Make something useful
in a few days.

what else?
-----------
Link to other notes like /this or ---this.
Proper URLs are also hyperlinked.
That's it.

roadmap
------------
* Not much else at this point. 
* Maybe add some sort of authentication thing.
